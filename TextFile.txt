The MERN Stack is a popular web development stack that consists of four main technologies: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It is known for its scalability and ease of use when handling large amounts of data.

Express.js is a lightweight web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a set of tools and utilities for routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests and responses.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render the user interface based on changes in data.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it ideal for building scalable and high-performance web applications.

Together, these technologies form the MERN Stack, which enables developers to build full-stack web applications using JavaScript for both the front-end and back-end. This stack is widely used for its simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency in developing modern web applications.
